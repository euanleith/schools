List of schools at https://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Statistics/Data-on-Individual-Schools/
  want to take out emails from list, and from teacherâ€™s emails (seeing any outside hosts, e.g. gmail)
  this will give the domain name, -> IP address -> look at dns/zgrab for info

Search by roll at https://www.education.ie/en/find-a-school/School-Detail/?roll=XXXXXX to get education.ie page for each school, where email and website can be found and compared to the above
  there's a bunch of schools without emails or urls given

Remove any emails at non-school addresses (e.g. eircom.net)

Compare 3 pages found to get ip and associated url
  -note some have multiple ip addresses -> need to try zgrab for both...
  -there's loads of schools with differences between these 3
  -i noticed a lot of 301 status codes (meaning moved permanently),
  which could have meant that i was using the wrong of the 3 urls,
  so i changed AddWebDetail so it checks through all 3 urls
  to find the most suitable (based on a hierarchy of status codes; 20x > 30x> 40x/50x (could be done better?))
    idk how good of an idea this was :)

Perform DNS lookup on these urls (on most suitable url(~) for each school)
  looking for;
    AAAA - IPv6 address
    MX - record of mail server (mail host)
    DS - fp which is set to the website the first time a user connects to it, so when website is accessed again, can see if ip has that fingerprint, i.e. if it doesn't, someone else is pretending to be that website
      -useful, but hard/annoying to implement?
    CAA - who can give certs (without one, anyone can give certs)
    SPF - says who can send mail (without one, anyone can send emails from that url?)
    TXT - readable info? -spf often found here???
    CNAME - pointer, will show host if any

Perform zgrab on these urls (on most suitable url(~) for each school)
  looking for; (?)
    port 80 - HTTP-dets
    port 443, with SNI - TLS-dets, HTTP-dets
    port 443, without SNI - TLS-dets, HTTP-dets
  notes:
    looks for the most suitable of the 3 urls by going with the first result found, but prioritising those with paths
    if port 80 returns a 30x, goes to the redirect (if it's different from the url just used), and uses that data instead, because that's the site that's actually used
      all redirections are stored in schools2019.xlsx in column 'AN'
    increased the timeout from 4 to 15 because several schools just needed more time to respond



Columns;
  email from list
  website of email (external ones (e.g. gmail) removed)
  roll number
  education.ie web page associated with roll number
  eircode
  email from education.ie page (indiv pg) (external ones removed)
  url from education.ie
  ip
  url
  dns lookup;
    AAAA
    MX
    DS
    CAA
    SPF
    TXT
  zgrab stuff
    order: port 80, 443(goes to default), 443 with sni;
      status_code (indicates if request successful)
      body_len
      !port 80;
        names (website host - who signed certificate?)
        fp (fingerprint (key))
        timely (if cert expired)
        self_signed (signed their own SSL cert (~issues...))
        rsalen (lengths of rsa public keys (bigger is better, should be 2^n))
        cipher_suite (method of encryption (which ones are good/bad?))
        browser_trusted (if who signed their cert is good(on a list))
  CNAME (should be in dns lookup, but was only added later)
  A (same; just making sure there's nothing weird)
  errors
  url used for zgrab
  redirects


Then look at the data:
